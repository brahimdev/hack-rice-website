		<h2> Flights </h2>
		<p> We'll be reimbursing based off your round trip flight cost.</p>
		<p> Here's some tips: We found Los Angeles flights to be significantly cheaper than San Diego, we found Sacramento flights to be significantly cheaper than San Jose or San Fransisco, and we found Newark flights to be significantly cheaper than NYC. We also reccomend flying on discount airlines when possible; Houston Hobby airport is usually cheaper than Bush Intercontinental.</p>
		<p> Here's a breakdown: </p>
